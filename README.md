The goal of this project was to dockerize nginx, wordpress and mariadb without fetching dockerhub images.
Everything had to be handmade, from the Dockerfile configurations to the tiniest details such as a custom conf file for nginx, custom entrypoint for wordpress or instructions for mariadb.

As seen in ft_transcendance, usually you can find usable docker images on duckerhub, but the goal of this project was to fully embrace what it is to make one yourself,
not because the school wants to annoy you, but to teach you problem solving.

You WILL 100% run into docker problems in every docker projects you'll work on, and this project is here to show you a glimpse of how useful it is to tinker around not the images,
but docker itself.
